## digit-classification
## Classification of digits using the sklearn dataset. 

Uses softmax regression to predict the digits. The dataset used is from sklearn.datasets.
Due to a relatively low number of data (1437 training examples and 360 test examples), the model was able to attain high accuracy.

The test set accuracy is 95%.

Created from scratch using only numpy and sklearn for some features.
